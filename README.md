This package contains function and algorithms to extend the [lidR](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR) package (versions > 2.0). These functions or algorithms are not yet or will not be included in the `lidR` package either:

- Because they are **experiemental** and not supported by a peer-reviewed and accessible publications. For example water bodies delineation methods that were not published. The `lidR` package only contains algorithms that are supported by a citation from the litterature. In `lidRplugins` I may explore new possibilities and maybe such functions will be moved into `lidR` later.
- Because they were judged **non suitable for `lidR`**. For example an algorithms for tree segmentation from a peer-reviewed publication that was found blazingly slow even after a C++ optimizations. For the sake of reproducibility these algorithms are provided as open source tools in `lidRplugins` but are not included in `lidR` because I believe they are not suitable for real applications.
- Because they were **not tested enought** and I'm not sure they are actually useful for the community.  Maybe such functions will be moved into `lidR` later on.

This package will NOT be submitted on CRAN and must be installed from github. It depends on `lidR (>= 3.0.0)`. Users **should not** base their important workflow on this package. It should be seen as a laboratory with more or less interesting content inside and this content can change without warning. 

```r
devtools::install_github("Jean-Romain/lidRplugins")
```

To install the package from github make sure you have a working development environment.

* **Windows**: Install [Rtools.exe](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).  
* **Mac**: Install `Xcode` from the Mac App Store.
* **Linux**: Install the R development package, usually called `r-devel` or `r-base-dev`
